# Overview

This project was created to deepen my understanding of game development concepts such as event-driven programming, real-time updates, collision detection, and managing game state within a graphical application. By building a complete game from scratch, I focused on improving my ability to structure interactive software and handle user input effectively.

The software is a 2D Snake-style arcade game built using Python and the Arcade framework. The player controls a snake using the arrow keys, guiding it around the screen to collect food. Each time the snake eats food, the score increases and the snake grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with itself. As the score increases, the game becomes more challenging by increasing the snake’s movement speed.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with a Python-based game framework and to better understand how game loops, timing, input handling, and rendering work together in a real-time application. This project helped reinforce core programming concepts while applying them in a practical and engaging way.

# Development Environment

The game was developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor. A Python virtual environment was used to manage dependencies and ensure a consistent development setup. The application was tested locally on a Windows system.

The software was written in Python. The primary library used was the Arcade framework, which provides tools for graphics rendering, keyboard input handling, window management, and game timing.

# Future Work

* Add sound effects for collecting food and for game over events
* Implement a start menu and pause functionality
* Introduce obstacles or power-ups that increase difficulty as levels progress
